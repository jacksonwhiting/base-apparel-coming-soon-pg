## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

The layout was a challenge going from the mobile view, to the two column layout with the picture taking up the entire right side of the screen.  I used the Picture element for the first time.  It would have been helpful to have a few more picture (of different sizes) to work with.  

I used Grid for the first time to setup the desktop layout.

### Continued development

Keep grinding and getting better!
